# obstacle_avoider_library
Simple library for obstacle avoider bot for school students 
This is an Arduino-based obstacle avoidance bot using an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04). The bot detects obstacles in front of it and prints the required action via Serial output.
A project example code file is also present with the name example.cpp
Hardware requirements
- Arduino Uno/Nano/ESP32/etc.
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- Breadboard & Jumper Wires
- (Optional) Motor Driver + Motors for movement

Setup instructions
- Step 1: Clone the Repository
- Step 2: Connect the Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- Step 3: Open Project in Arduino IDE
  - Launch the Arduino IDE.
  - Open the main.ino file located in the src/ folder.
  - Make sure obstacle.h and obstacle.cpp are in the correct lib/obstacle/ directory relative to the sketch.
- Step 4: Modify and Verify the Code
- Step 5: Upload the Code to Arduino
  - Connect your Arduino board via USB.
  - Select the correct Board and COM Port from the Tools menu.
  - Click Upload (â†’ arrow icon) to upload the code.
- Step 6: Open the Serial Monitor and ensure its working
